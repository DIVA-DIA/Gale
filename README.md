# V7 Gale 

This framework is an evolved fork of [DeepDIVA: A Highly-Functional Python Framework for Reproducible Experiments](https://diva-dia.github.io/DeepDIVAweb/index.html).
The major differences are the full adoption of an object oriented programming design, the polishing of the workflow, the introduction of an optimized inference-use case and a better isolation between the tasks.

This work has been conducted during an intership at V7 Labs, London, UK.
